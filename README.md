## What is PenguinCoin?

PenguinCoin is an innovative digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Built on peer-to-peer technology, PenguinCoin operates with no central authority: transaction management and money issuance are carried out collectively by the network. PenguinCoin Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

Visit our website at [https://penguincoin.org](https://penguincoin.org) for more information.

## Development

PenguinCoin Core development follows an open process. Anyone can contribute code or documentation through pull requests on GitHub.

### Repository Organization

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be stable. For production use, refer to the [release tags](https://github.com/penguincoin-project/penguincoin/tags) which indicate stable versions.

The GUI is developed in the separate [penguincoin-project/gui](https://github.com/penguincoin-project/gui) repository.

### Development Process

Our development workflow is described in detail in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Key points:

- Code changes happen through pull requests
- All PRs need review and approval
- Continuous integration ensures quality
- Semantic versioning is used for releases

## Testing

Quality assurance is critical for a currency system. We employ several testing strategies:

### Automated Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run with `make check`
- **Functional Tests**: Run with `test/functional/test_runner.py`

Developers are encouraged to write tests for new code. See [src/test/README.md](src/test/README.md) for more information.

### Manual QA Testing

Changes should be tested by someone other than the developer who wrote the code, especially for large or high-risk changes. Adding a test plan to pull requests helps reviewers.
